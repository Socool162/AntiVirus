=== Antivirus Program with C language ===

Folder "Bai_4_AntiVirus_Submit" contains main code to AntiVirus and file antiVurus.exe (compiled before)

Folder "cleaned_files" contains 7 files (not .sys) clean I tested before (had been remove section .infect and call OEP exactly)

Folder "test" contains 8 files infected (had .infect section) that I injected from fileInfect 

Note:
+ Download file antiVirus.exe and folder test (8 file infected) to check. You will have exactly 7 file in folder cleaned_files
+ In folder cleaned_files, file cleaned before will be checked to not OVERRIDE (check name)
  
+ GUI will be updated soon....
