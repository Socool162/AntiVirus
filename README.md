=== Antivirus Program with C language ===

Folder "Bai_4_AntiVirus_Submit" contains main code to AntiVirus and file antiVurus.exe had been compiled before.

Folder "cleaned_files" contains files clean (had been remove section .infect and call OEP exactly).

Folder "test" contains 8 files include 
+ 3 file infected (addNumber.dll; check_subdir32.exe; pe_loader32.exe)
+ 3 file clean (name...- Copy)
+ 2 file some just check only PE disinfect

Note:
+ I test in path "L:\test" and "L:\cleaned_files" so if you want to test, just change your wanted path in my C code.
+ In folder cleaned_files, file cleaned before will be checked to not override (check name)
